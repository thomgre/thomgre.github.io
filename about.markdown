Hey there!

My name is Thomas Grendel. I'm a Tech Lead and Azure Cloud Consultant at Fresh Minds. A relatively
young "consultancy" company at Leiden with a culture of transparency, entrepreneurship, ownership
and fun internal collaboration. I have worked as a developer and software engineer for over 15 years
in several roles and modes of operation, always looking for opportunities for personal growth and
a switch of professional scenery.

I have a wide range of professional experience in the realisation of all kinds of software
solutions, such as workloads and infrastructure on the Cloud, backend services, (REST) API's,
middleware, web apps, third-party integrations, custom workflows and complex business processes.
This experience was both with greenfield and existing IT landscapes.

My focus and passion is on the Microsoft stack (.NET + Azure). Daily responsibilities include 
the analysis of business cases/requirements, advice on solution architecture, implementation 
of features, bugfixing, testing and automating CI/CD tasks. Overall, senior level expertise on 
the complete Application Lifecycle, from analysis, design, implementation, testing, 
deployment and monitoring (observability). This is done using Agile, DevOps, GitOps and 
Cloud Adoption Framework best practices.

I highly value quality of delivered work and I'm always looking for opportunities for improvement 
and automation.
