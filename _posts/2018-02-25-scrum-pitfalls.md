There is no doubt using Agile, and specifically the Scrum framework, for software development has proven benefits above other ways of working such as Waterfall. Working as a IT consultant and software developer there are still pitfalls I come across that could be easily mitigated. Above all, Agile is not just a framework or process; it is a mindset that requires cultural changes when making the change from more traditional, waterfall-like, development to Agile/Scrum.

## What is Agile about?


## What are common pitfalls and the solution?

### Absent Product Owner
The Product Owner is a proxy between the Development Team and a stakeholder from the business making decisions on requirements, scope and resources. As such, the PO is usually someone with business experience more so than software development experience and is not required, even discouraged, to be physically present during daily development. As a developer is doesn't help if there's a business person breathing down your neck on a daily basis. It could however lead to a situation where the PO is more focused on business processes than being available for the team. The PO should be present at all Scrum events, except the Daily Scrum, because the development team should hear about business decisions that can impact development as soon as possible. It is up to the PO to determine what's really important and what not to keep noise for the development team low.

#### Solution
It is up to the Scrum Master to coach the PO about the importance of being available at Scrum events and being available to the development team when needed. Pro-active behavior is also needed to update the team about new business decisions that could impact the project scope.


### Adopting formal events and terminology only
#### Solution


### Company politics and no agile culture
#### Solution


### Scrum Master as a management role

#### Solution


### Cross-team alignment

#### Solution


### No multi-disciplinary team

#### Solution
